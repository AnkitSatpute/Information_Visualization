Various Information Visualization Techniques

In this section I have tried and implemented info visualization techniques

1. A overview of image or data visualization in the corner of the screen.
the overview frame remains with its size and shows always the entire diagram.
2. A marker rectangle which highlights the current viewable area of the main view within
the overview frame. (diagram.MouseController class).
3. Made overview window arbitrary placeale.
4. Scatterplot matrix realization for depicting multi dimensional data.
5. Then implemented brushing and linking technique to mak points in a 
single scatterplot for being highlighted in all plots. 
(scatterplot.MouseController)
6. Used same dataset but now parallel coordinates display.
(paracoords.View class)
7. Marking technique for highlighting paths.
(paracords.MouseController)
8. Extension to above: Movable axes in horizontal direction.
9. Graphical Fisheye View of Graphs
basically implementation of this papers
Graphical Fisheye Views of Graphs (1992)
Graphical Fisheye Views (1993)
10. Extended above technique for using the current mouse coordinates as focus point
while moving the pointer.
