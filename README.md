Various Information Visualization Techniques

In this section, I have tried and implemented info visualization techniques.

1. A overview of image or data visualization in the corner of the screen.
the overview frame remains at its size and always shows the entire diagram.
2. A marker rectangle that highlights the current viewable area of the main view within
the overview frame. (diagram.MouseController class).
3. Made overview window arbitrarily replaceable.
4. Scatterplot matrix realization for depicting multi-dimensional data.
5. Then, brushing and linking techniques were implemented to mark points in a 
single scatterplot for being highlighted in all plots. 
(scatterplot.MouseController)
6. Used the same dataset but now parallel coordinates display.
(paracoords.View class)
7. Marking technique for highlighting paths.
(paracords.MouseController)
8. Extension to above Movable axes in the horizontal direction.
9. Graphical Fisheye View of Graphs
basically an implementation of this papers
Graphical Fisheye Views of Graphs (1992)
Graphical Fisheye Views (1993)
10. Extended the above technique for using the current mouse coordinates as the focus point
while moving the pointer.
